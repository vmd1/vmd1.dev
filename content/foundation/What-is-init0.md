This will be a short one. 

For those who didn't know, `init 0` is essentially another way to shutdown a unix-based system, by changing the init run level to 0, essentially shutting down the system in a controlled manner. 

I chose it because its a reference to Unix (and Linux), and I spend a lot of time interacting with Linux. That doesn’t mean I won’t post anything about what I do on my Windows PC - this blog is supposed to be a digital notepad of **all** things techy, and so it won’t be limited to just that.
