# Welcome to Init0

```bash

```  
  
Hey! Welcome to **Init0**, my digital notepad for all things techy, where I share whatever I happen to be working on at the moment.

Init0 is a place for anything, from Home Automation, to my programming endeavours, to me trying to self-host half of Google.

Whether you’re here to learn something new, see what I’ve been building, or just take a peek into my workflow — I’m glad you stopped by.

Thanks, and I hope to see you around,
Vivaan
