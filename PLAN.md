# Hugo Site Conversion Plan

This document outlines the plan to convert the entire `vmd1.dev` static site into a full Hugo-powered website. This will unify the portfolio and blog into a single, manageable project.

## 1. Project Restructuring

*   **Hugo at the Root:** The project root (`/workspaces/vmd1.dev`) will be initialized as a Hugo site.
*   **New Theme:** A custom theme (e.g., `vmd-theme`) will be created in the `themes` directory to house all layouts and assets.
*   **Asset Migration:**
    *   The content of `index.html` will be moved to the theme's homepage layout at `themes/vmd-theme/layouts/index.html`.
    *   `style.css` and `spotlight.js` will be moved to `themes/vmd-theme/static/css/` and `themes/vmd-theme/static/js/` respectively.
    *   The original `index.html` will be removed after its content is migrated.

## 2. Hugo Configuration (`hugo.yaml`)

*   A `hugo.yaml` file will be created at the root.
*   It will define the site's `baseURL`, `title`, `theme`, and author information.
*   Parameters for Google Analytics, Giscus, and social media links will be added for easy management.

## 3. Theme Layouts (`themes/vmd-theme/`)

*   **Design Consistency:** All pages and components (including blog posts and lists) must strictly adhere to the existing "cards + liquid glass + colour scheme" design system defined in `style.css`.
*   **`layouts/_default/baseof.html`:** This will be the master template, containing the core HTML structure (`<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`), the spotlight div, and calls to partials for the header and footer. All other pages will extend this base.
*   **`layouts/index.html`:** This will be the homepage layout, based on the current `index.html`.
    *   The "About Me" text will be directly embedded in the HTML layout.
    *   The "Latest Posts" section will be dynamically generated by ranging over the blog posts.
    *   The "Featured Projects" and "All Projects" modal will fetch data from the GitHub API as it does now.
*   **`layouts/partials/head.html`:** Will contain the contents of the `<head>` tag, including CSS links, meta tags, and Google Analytics scripts.
*   **`layouts/partials/header.html`:** Will contain the site's main navigation bar. It will include a search button that, when clicked, reveals a search input field within the navbar for a seamless search experience.
*   **`layouts/partials/comments.html`:** Will contain the Giscus comment section configuration.
*   **Blog Layouts:**
    *   A `blog` content section will be created (`content/blog/`).
    *   **`layouts/blog/list.html`:** A page to list all blog posts, displayed as cards with the liquid glass effect.
    *   **`layouts/blog/single.html`:** The template for individual blog posts, wrapped in a liquid glass card container. It will feature:
        *   Post metadata (title, date, tags).
        *   A Table of Contents.
        *   Styling for post content (headings, code blocks) consistent with the site's color scheme.
        *   The Giscus comment section (via `comments.html` partial).
    *   **Accessibility:** The hover animation on post cards will be disabled to improve accessibility and user experience.

## 4. Content Structure

*   **`content/blog/`:** This directory will hold all blog post markdown files.
*   **`archetypes/default.md`:** A template for new posts with pre-defined front matter (`title`, `date`, `tags`, `draft`).

## 5. Development Workflow

1.  **Initialize:** Run `hugo new site . --force` in the project root.
2.  **Theme Setup:** Create the new theme structure.
3.  **Migrate:** Move `style.css`, `spotlight.js`, and the content of `index.html` into the theme. Update asset paths.
4.  **Homepage:** Build the `index.html` layout. The "Latest Posts" section will be populated with Hugo variables.
5.  **Blog:** Create the `blog` section with `single.html` and `list.html` layouts.
6.  **Features:** Integrate Giscus, Google Analytics, and the Table of Contents.
7.  **Testing:** Use `hugo server` to build and test the complete site.
8.  **Cleanup:** Remove the original `index.html` file.

This integrated approach will make the entire site more modular, easier to update, and entirely managed by Hugo's content system.
