    <p>I'm Vivaan, a teen dev who builds secure, self-hosted systems, and breaks them (ethically) for fun. This is my portfolio page where I dump my projects, write-ups, and blog posts about what I'm learning along the way.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">Right now, I'm working on a few open-source projects - mostly related to security tools and automation. I love digging into code, figuring out how stuff works under the hood, and then building (or breaking) things just to see what happens.</p>
