            <p>I'm Vivaan, a student who's super into programming, security, and breaking things (ethically, of course 😅). This is my portfolio page where I dump my projects, write-ups, and blog posts about what I'm learning along the way.</p>
            <p>Right now, I'm working on a few open-source projects - mostly related to security tools and automation. I love digging into code, figuring out how stuff works under the hood, and then building (or breaking) things just to see what happens. Every bug, every fix, every “oh no why is this broken” moment makes me better.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I'm into gaming, reading, and working with A/V + Lighting setups. I'm always looking for ways to challenge myself and pick up new skills, whether that's learning a new programming language, exploring cybersecurity challenges, or contributing to communities online.</p>
            <p>This page will keep growing as I add more projects, write more blog posts, and (hopefully) ship some cool stuff that others find useful. Feel free to check out my socials/blog through the links above and reach out if you wanna chat or collab.</p>
